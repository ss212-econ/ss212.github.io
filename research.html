            <h3>Knowing The Unknown: Experimentation Under Delayed Success with Shraman Banerjee</h3>
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We consider a dynamic principal-agent relationship with experimentation. In our exponential two-armed bandit model, the agent can achieve breakthroughs and breakdowns 
            from both known (Arm 0) and unknown (Arm 1) risky arms. We consider inconclusive breakthroughs for Arm 1. Since Arm 1 is unknown and less rewarding, 
            we develop a novel mechanism by the principal, which involves rewarding failures and punishing fake successes, in order to incentivize the agent to experiment with Arm1. 
            We derive the optimal deadline for experimentation which ensures full honesty from the agent. Our proposed mechanism can identify the nature of Arm 1.</p>
